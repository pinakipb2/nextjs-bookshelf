Freshman tennis prodigy Ryouma Echizen enrolls in the prestigious institution with his eyes set on claiming a regular position on the Boys' Tennis Team.

His teammates, however, are reluctant to accept him into their starting lineup, as he hasn't proven himself worthy of the spot.

With their new \"super rookie\" on the team, Seishun is ready to take on anything that comes their way. With a varied assortment of rivals and opponents that can threaten their chance at the title, the Seishun team needs to give it their all in order to rise to the top.
