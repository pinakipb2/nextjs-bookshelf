Genius plastic surgeon Dr. Manabe saved Randou's life and went to work on his face, gradually reconstructing it based on a photograph found in the wreckage of the bus. But in a cruel twist of fate, the photo that the doctor used as his reference was not a picture of Randou, but of Rina Kurimi, the girl whom Randou has a crush on!
