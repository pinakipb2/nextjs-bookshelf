However, just as she had her first bite, a young male jumps out of the peach! And before Suzuri knows it, she's the 18th master to Momo who could do anything that Suzuri commands! What kind of danger would they encounter on their journey as they face a god that goes by the name Kyuui? And what dark secret does Momo have!?
